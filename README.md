<h1 align="center">Tass</h1>
<p align="center">A pager for tabular data</p>

`tass` - it's like `less`, but for tables!  It can read CSV/TSV and parquet
files, and even ND-JSON in a pinch.  It looks like this:

You can see tass's schema inference in action here. The fourth and fifth
columns only contain a small number of unique values, so tass colour-codes
them automatically. The columns to the right of those are numerical, so tass
right-aligns them and shows negative values in red.

This demo shows data being piped into (an older version of) tass. You can also
open files which are still being appended to, and new rows will appear as the
file grows.

## Installing

If you already have rust, you can install tass like this:

```
$ cargo install tass
```

## Usage

You can pass a filename, or pipe data to stdin:

```
$ tass mydata.csv
$ cat mydata.csv | tass
```

For manipulating data, my advice is to use a spreadsheet (for small datasets)
or dataframe library (for larger datasets).  Sometimes you just want to quickly
inspect the contents of a file though, and that's what tass is for.

## Tips & tricks

Here are some more tips for working with large CSV files:

* If you want to see summary statistics but don't care about the underlying
  data itself, you can still use VisiData/Excel/etc.: just downsample it first.
  This will reduce the precision of your stats and plots, but not the overall
  shape (probably).  [xsv] has a subcommand that can do this for you.
* If you want exact answers to complex questions, use a dataframe library.
  Alternatively, consider dumping your CSV into a sqlite database and working
  with that instead.
* For ad-hoc computations on CSV files, take a look at [frawk] - it's
  really nice.
